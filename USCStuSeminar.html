        <h1>USC Student Topology Seminar</h1>
        <p>This is a complement seminar to USC topology seminar, where we have graduate students in geometry and topology giving expository talks on topics they're interested in. Here's the schedule. The location and time are the same as our <a href="https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/topologyseminar">USC topology seminar</a>.</p>

            <td>02/06/2023</td><td>Yasin Uskuplu</td><td>Quantum Steenrod Squares and Quantum Version of the Cartan Relation</td><td>The Steenrod squares are the cohomology operations characterized by a set of axioms including the Cartan relation. These operations define the “Steenrod square” which is an enhancement of the classical cup product and satisfies the Cartan relation. In this talk, I will introduce quantum versions of the Steenrod squares and the Cartan relation. Similarly, these operations define the quantum version of the “Steenrod square” which is an enhancement of the quantum cup product defined on the quantum cohomology of closed monotone symplectic manifolds. By giving some computational examples for the n-dimensional complex projective space, we will see that we need some quantum error terms / quantum deformations leading us to have a correct quantum version of the Cartan relation. These computational results will imply that similar approaches also apply to Fano toric manifolds.</td>

            <td>09/06/2023</td><td>Siyang Liu</td><td>Symplectic Geometry of $A_m$-Milnor Fibers and Hilbert Schemes</td><td>In this talk we will discuss the symplectic geometry of $A_m$-Milnor Fibers and its relation to Slodowy slices. Following the work of Mak and Smith, we will compute the Fukaya-Seidel category of Hilbert scheme of points on Am-Milnor fibers with prescribed superpotentials, compute the Floer cohomology, discuss its formality and generation, and show that it is quasi-isomorphic to the parabolic category $\mathcal{O}$.</td>

            <td>09/13/2023</td><td>Jishnu Bose</td><td>Monodromy of Fukaya-Seidel categories mirror to toric varieties </td><td>The Picard group of an algebraic variety naturally acts on the category of Coherent sheaves by tensoring with a line bundle. In the case of a toric variety, mirror symmetry induces an action of this Picard group on the Fukaya- Seidel category on the B- side. Following the work of Hanlon, we'll discuss how this mirror action is described as the monodromy of a family of superpotentials indexed by a parameter on the circle. </td>

            <td>09/20/2023</td><td>Boxi Hao</td><td>Abouzaid’s Generation Criterion for Fukaya Categories</td><td>We will start by reviewing some geometric/algebraic preliminaries about wrapped Fukaya categories. We will also go through the construction of the open-closed map between Hochschild homology of the Fukaya category and the symplectic cohomology. Then the discussion will be focused on the geometric criterion for generating the Fukaya category by Abouzaid.</td>

            <td>09/27/2023</td><td>David O'Connor</td><td>Generating the Wrapped Fukaya Category with a Cotangent Fibre</td><td>In this talk, we explore the generation of the wrapped Fukaya category focusing on cotangent bundles. Building on the foundations presented last week, we employ Abouzaid's Generation Criterion to demonstrate that cotangent fibres not only split-generate but also generate the wrapped Fukaya category. Along the way we will see how the algebra of chains on the based loop space recovers the derived wrapped Fukaya category.</td>

            <td>10/04/2023</td><td>Jonathan Michala</td><td>Introduction to Symplectic Field Theory</td><td>We will follow Chris Wendl's introduction of Symplectic Field Theory. SFT is an algebraic formalism used to define invariants of contact manifolds. We will discuss historical background involving the Arnold and Weinstein conjectures, as well as Morse, Floer, and contact homology. Then, we will sketch the algebraic structure of SFT and give example applications to distinguishing contact structures and obstructing exact symplectic cobordisms.
